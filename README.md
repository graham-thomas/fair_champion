Identify a champion of FAIR data management practices from a list of publications

## Description
This project was inspired by the ELIXIR All Hands meeting 2025 hosted in Exeter, UK. The goal is to create a tool that can analyse a list of scientific publications and identify the one that best exemplifies FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data management practices. The tool can be applied to any list of publications, but the primary idea is to apply it to the Monthly Biosciences Newsletter, which features recent publications in the Biosciences department at the University of Exeter.

### Aims
- This is an open project intended as a learning exercise for those interested in coding and data science. 
- It will be shared on the bioinformatexe github page for members of that network to contribute to and learn from.
- It is a playground for community members to practice their github flow, posting and closing issues.
- An opportunity to work collaboratively on a real project that will produce a useful output.

### Current state
- Incomplete - work in progress
